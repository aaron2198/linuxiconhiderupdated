# Icon Hider Updated

### Features:
- Indicator Icon with icons to hide
- Settings page to hide the extension icon itself
- Loads "lazily" by having a 500ms delay in the initialization to fix the issue with PopOS PopShell icon showing up in the statusArea which will cause the icon to always reappear on boot/login/logout etc..
