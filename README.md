### Features:
- Indicator Icon with icons to hide & open settings
- Settings page to hide the extension icon itself and the other icons
- Loads "lazily" by having a 500ms delay in the initialization/enabling-phase to fix the issue with PopOS PopShell icon showing up in the statusArea which will cause the icon to always reappear on boot/login/logout etc..

### Contribute
- Just fork and make a pull-request
